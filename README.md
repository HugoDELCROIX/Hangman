# Hangman

## Creation of an Hangman game with Java.
> **Hangman** is a **paper and pencil guessing game** for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by **suggesting letters** within **a certain number of guesses**. 

Here the word will be automatically defined by the machine and the game will be playable alone.
